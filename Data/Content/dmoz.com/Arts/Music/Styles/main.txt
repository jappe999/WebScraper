Characterizing performers and performances by style makes the vast subject of music easier to discuss and understand. Styles may include genres such as classical, rock and jazz; subgenres such as classical/opera, rock/metal, and jazz/ragtime; and types of music such as choral, Native American, and holiday. Genres may be defined by technical aspects such as instrumentation, harmony, melody, rhythm, and form, or according to schemes devised by writers and critics. Music types may be defined by these criteria as well as others such as subject matter, chronology, or performance context, and may cut across genre lines.A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y ZComplete ListSubcategories1By Decade392Related categories2Arts Radio Formats Music0Shopping Entertainment Recordings Audio Music Specialty499Sites8All Music GuidePortal built around articles by music journalists describing music genres, with links and reviews.American Popular MusicOnline publication contains stories that illustrate how Americans, borrowing from diverse musical traditions, have contributed to humanity\xe2\x80\x99s universal language.[PDF]DataDragon: Music Genre SamplerChildren\'s site with simple definitions of a few genres including rock, Celtic, and classical with artist and site links.Ectophiles Guide by GenreSelf-described "Guide to Good Music" from a group founded in 1991 to support the music of singer Happy Rhodes.
